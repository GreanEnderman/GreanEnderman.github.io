# Getting Started with Next.js 14

Next.js 14 brings powerful new features to the table, especially with the App Router. Let's explore how you can leverage these capabilities.

## Why Next.js 14?

The latest version includes:

- **Improved Performance**: Faster builds and optimized routing
- **Server Components**: Better performance by default
- **Streaming**: Progressive page rendering
- **Built-in Optimization**: Image, font, and script optimization

## Creating Your First App

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app --typescript --tailwind --app
```

This command sets up a new project with:
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- App Router for routing

## Server vs Client Components

One of the key concepts in Next.js 14 is the distinction between server and client components.

### Server Components (Default)

```tsx
export default async function ServerComponent() {
  const data = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
  return <div>{data.title}</div>;
}
```

### Client Components

```tsx
"use client";

import { useState } from 'react';

export function ClientComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>{count}</button>;
}
```
